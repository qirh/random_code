Small react app to track how long it takes for paint to dry.


To do:
- [ ] Actually paint the canvas
- [ ] Add payment options to speed up time


To run:
- `npm i`.
- `npm run start`. Note that the `PUBLIC_URL` is set to `/` in the `package.json` so that the `jeopardy.mp3` is referenced correctly.
